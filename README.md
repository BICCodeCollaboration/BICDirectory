# BICDirectory
The first project we can work on as a unit for a tangible real world solution - creating a directory for allowing consultants in the group to share skills and contact information.

We can add more BIC members with differing skillsets to deliver future solutions in a friendly community setting while building our respective skills and experience levels.

10/20/2018 - The project is still in it's inception phase and we still need to identify interested collaborator (technical & non-technical), directory architecture, and intended delivery dates.

Current questionnaire - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uC9H4UIRJb7oDIazw3B36y_4dk1Nn8RdYCys90F2WKA/edit (First iteration to be updated in the future.)
